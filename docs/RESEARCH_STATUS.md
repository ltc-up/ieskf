# Research status

A complete inertial error-state research prototype exists. Pose/full-state elimination and fixed-association constrained optimization were investigated numerically; those findings are not a deployment qualification.

Dynamic map association remains unqualified for reliable convergence. A first non-converged geometry update can over-contract position uncertainty while leaving velocity uncertainty substantial; propagation then creates strong position–velocity conditional recovery. Large proposed other-state corrections are mathematically explained, but their physical validity is not established.

AA preserved the prediction, wheel and geometry models and investigated actual carried state separately from raw proposals. Authorized de-identified aggregate results are published in the self-contained Phase AA report; full event-level results remain private. Typical geometry improvements do not imply elimination of worst cases; rejecting a proposal is not the same as observing a real state spike.

Next priority: update convergence/association eligibility and credible information/posterior handling, while maintaining a fixed independent preprocessing front end. No independent localization accuracy, long-term statistical calibration, live scheduling or production suitability has been established. The production system remains unchanged.

Research recording policy: each completed or failed phase must include self-contained results/failures, manifest input/config/code identity, index/status updates, reviewed public commit and a normal push to main. Failed authentication or remote conflicts must be reported; never force-push. See AGENTS.md.
